Note :  idCount, noteArrayList are instance variable in app Main class 
	all fxml controller class must extends this Main class to use and modify these variable

- Create new note by mouse clicking on context menu's element or a shortcut New Note
       On event listener (in fxml controller class), we're gonna : 
      + Create a Note object :Note note = new Note()
        then add this note object to an ArrayList of Note object named for example noteArrayList 
	List<Note> noteArrayList = new ArrayList<Note>(); 
	this noteArrayList is an instance variable on App Main class
      + From Note object, create XML file by using Serializers(or JAXB)
      + Use static method Add(String idNote) on class NotesDOM to add new <Note> </Note> to XML file
      + Set idCount++; then idNote can be retrieved and set element <id></id> on XML file 
	This idCount variable is also used to set indexes of noteArrayList with 0-based when adding 
	new Note objects to noteArrayList
- Mouse click on a Note label : to display a Note content(title and text) on textField and textArea
      + Static method loadNoteContent() from class NotesDOM is invoked  
	This method is gonna load a Note element <Note> </Note> from XML file with corresponding idNote
- Update Note's content (on XML file) when changes were detected
      + Find ways to detect changes on Note content (Title, Text, Hashtags)
      + Call static method update(); from NotesDOM class to update changes to XML file
      + autoSave(int Timer)?????????
- Delete a note when user clicks on context menu's element or a shortcut Delete Node
      + Make changes on variables :  
	idCount--;
	Delete corresponding Note object on noteArrayList and re-organize ArrayList indexes
      + Call method deleteNote() from class NotesDOM to delete Note Content on XML file
